# Machine Learning Tutorials - Part 6: Ensemble Techniques

Welcome to **Machine Learning Tutorials - Part 6: Ensemble Techniques**, where we explore some of the most powerful techniques used to improve the accuracy and robustness of machine learning models by combining multiple algorithms. This tutorial covers **Voting (Soft and Hard)**, **Random Forest**, **Bagging**, and **Boosting** methods such as **AdaBoost** and **XGBoost**, as well as the advanced technique of **Stacking**.

## Introduction
In this part, we focus on **ensemble methods**, which combine multiple models to improve the overall performance of predictions. The key techniques covered in this tutorial include:
- **Voting Classifier**:
  - **Hard Voting**: Predicts the majority class based on the output of individual models.
  - **Soft Voting**: Averages the predicted probabilities to determine the final prediction.
- **Random Forest**: An extension of bagging that uses decision trees, where each tree is trained on a random subset of features.
- **Bagging**: A method that creates multiple versions of a model and averages them to improve accuracy and reduce variance.
- **Boosting**: Techniques that build models sequentially, with each model correcting the errors of the previous one.
  - **AdaBoost**: A boosting method that adjusts the weights of incorrect predictions.
  - **XGBoost**: An efficient and powerful implementation of gradient boosting.
- **Stacking**: Combines the predictions of several base models using a meta-model that learns to make final predictions based on these outputs.
